- **Broca's Area**: Involved in word formation and speech production
- **Wernicke's Area**: Handles language comprehension
- **Angular Gyrus**: Connects visual symbols to their meanings

### Executive Function
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Manages working memory and decision-making
- **Anterior Cingulate**: Monitors conflicts and errors
- **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex**: Handles cognitive flexibility

## Cognitive Benefits of Regular Puzzle Solving

### 1. Enhanced Memory
Regular puzzle solving strengthens both short-term and long-term memory

### 2. Improved Problem-Solving Skills
Puzzles teach valuable problem-solving strategies

### 3. Increased Cognitive Flexibility
Regular puzzle solving enhances mental agility
